//! # zed-orm-core
//!
//! Canonical, opaque SeaORM boundary for the `zed-pkg` organization.
//!
//! The crate consumes the Zed schema slice generated from
//! `ORESoftware/k8s-libs-and-shared-defs`; it does not own migrations or expose
//! raw ORM sessions. Web/default consumers receive only [`ReadContext`] and
//! named functions under [`read`]. API consumers must explicitly enable the
//! `read-write` feature to compile [`WriteContext`] and [`write`].
//!
//! This crate never defines an independent schema and carries no migration
//! tooling: migrations belong exclusively to the owning API server via
//! `declarative-migrations`. The feature split expresses intent — the
//! authoritative boundary is the web tier's SELECT-only database identity,
//! because Cargo feature resolution is additive across a dependency graph.
