//! Read-only, policy-aware named query functions.

//! This module is the default consumer's entire view of the database. Business
//! reads added here must carry tenant/user scope and apply redaction. Generated
//! entities and raw query builders stay private to this crate. Prefer
//! `get_published_items_for_tenant(tenant_id)`-style named contracts over
//! anything that hands a caller a query builder.
